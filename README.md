# Weather App

This project is a simple weather app that allows users to check the current weather and a 5-day forecast for a specified city. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it fetches weather data using the MetaWeather API (which does not require an API key) or by using simulated data for educational purposes.

## Features

- **Search for a City:** Users can enter a city name to retrieve the current weather and a 5-day forecast.
- **Display Current Weather:** The app displays the temperature, weather conditions, and city name for the specified location.
- **5-Day Forecast:** Users can view a 5-day weather forecast, including temperature and weather conditions for each day.
- **Light-Blue Background:** The app has a visually appealing design with a light-blue background resembling a clear sky over a field.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For the structure of the app.
- **CSS:** For styling the app, including a light-blue background.
- **JavaScript:** For handling user input, fetching weather data, and updating the UI.
